# things-combo

The component that prints the data received by things-combo.items to a combo box and displays the selected value in a field.

Example:

```html
      <things-combo
        items="[{name: 'item1', descrption: 'First Item'},
                {name: 'itme2', description: 'Second Item'}]"
        label-path="description"
        value-path="name">
      </things-combo>
```

## Dependencies

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can install that via:

    npm install -g bower

Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

    bower install


## Playing With Your Element

If you wish to work on your element in isolation, we recommend that you use
[Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) to keep your element's
bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polymer-cli

And you can run it via:

    polymer serve

Once running, you can preview your element at
`http://localhost:8080/components/things-combo/`, where `things-combo` is the name of the directory containing it.


## Testing Your Element

Simply navigate to the `/test` directory of your element to run its tests. If
you are using Polyserve: `http://localhost:8080/components/things-combo/test/`

### web-component-tester

The tests are compatible with [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).
Install it via:

    npm install -g web-component-tester

Then, you can run your tests on _all_ of your local browsers via:

    wct

#### WCT Tips

`wct -l chrome` will only run tests in chrome.

`wct -p` will keep the browsers alive after test runs (refresh to re-run).

`wct test/some-file.html` will test only the files you specify.


## Yeoman support

If you'd like to use Yeoman to scaffold your element that's possible. The official [`generator-polymer`](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-polymer) generator has a [`seed`](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-polymer#seed) subgenerator.
